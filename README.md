# How-to-make-a-Twitter-Bot-in-Python
Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as “tweets“. In this article we will make a Twitter Bot using Python.

Python as well as Javascript can be used to develop an automatic Twitter bot that can do many tasks by its own such as:

1)Retweets the tweets with particular #hastags.
2)Favourites/Likes the tweets with particular #hashtags.
3)Follows the users who tweets with particular #hashtags.
4)Can also DM the users if granted with the permission.
